- Mining sector governance and transparency
- Value chain industrialization (processing, refining)
- Critical minerals for energy transition (batteries, renewables)
- Artisanal mining formalization and support
- Local content requirements and beneficiation
- Regional mineral trade integration

OUTPUT STYLE:
- Strategic focus on value addition
- Balance resource extraction with sustainability
- Emphasis on industrialization and jobs
- Evidence from successful case studies
- Align with African Mining Vision
