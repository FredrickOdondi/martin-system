[Lazarus Ogero]: As you might be well aware, this is our first meeting. And so there are a number of things I would love us to discuss. Before that, I would love us to discuss. Before that, I'm a man of God, so I should probably start with a prayer. So I will pray, Father in heaven, we thank you for the gift of life, thank you for giving us the giving us the experience of living in this wonderful universe that you created. Further, we have some discussions on the table. We invite your panelists to the table we say. that whatever we say might be meaningful. We hope that it's going to be the end of the meeting. Currently, the meeting this week, as you have said, week. As you have seen on the text, this meeting is just a touch upon the theme of that week. We should already know by now. I am going to read out a certain text. I will see if I can continue from there. Key different points include primary of getting testing. So... This document outlines how to interact with API managed boards. Uh, We shall see. if we continue or not. So fixed, the system was generating minutes from live transcript before the meeting ended, digest the meeting, and only proceeds recesses. meeting and only proceeds recesses. I think we shall continue from there next time round. Thank you for your time.
